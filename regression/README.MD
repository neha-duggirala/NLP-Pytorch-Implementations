# RNN - Recurrent Neural Network:

## Why RNN and not CNN?
While CNNs excel at capturing important features in data, they fall short when processing sequential images, as they don't consider the context of previous images. It's like reading a storybook where you can't jump to the 10th chapter without understanding the first 9 chapters.

## What kind of data suits RNNs?
RNNs are ideal for sequential or time series data, as they effectively capture context and temporal dependencies.

## Activation Functions:
RNNs typically use tanh (hyperbolic tangent) and sigmoid activation functions in their hidden layers.
